# eponym
A small C++ utility for creating function and method aliases

**Requires: C++ 11 compatibe compiler and standard library**

eponym is a useful set of macros that allow developers to create function and method
aliases. It eases the burden of choosing composition over inheritance by simplifying
the lifting of nested member methods into the composing type. It can also be used to
provide a simple mapping for one function name to another, just in case your favorite
generic algorithm or type chooses a different name for a function.

Please refer to the [samples](samples/) directory to see helpful use cases.
